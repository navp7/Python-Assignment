    "In machine learning, an ensemble technique refers to a strategy where multiple machine learning models are combined to improve the overall predictive performance. The idea behind ensemble methods is to leverage the collective wisdom of multiple models to produce better results than what any single model can achieve. Ensembles are often used in the context of both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods typically involve creating multiple base models, which can be of the same or different types (e.g., decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines), and then combining their predictions to make a final prediction. Popular ensemble techniques include bagging, boosting, and stacking.\n",

    "Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Performance:** Ensembles can significantly improve the predictive performance of models. By combining the strengths of different models, they can compensate for individual model weaknesses and yield more accurate and robust predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reduced Overfitting:** Ensembles often reduce overfitting because they aggregate predictions from multiple models. This helps to capture the general patterns in the data and reduces the influence of noise or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Stability:** Ensembles are more stable than individual models. They are less sensitive to changes in the training data and are less likely to produce dramatically different results with slight variations in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Complex Relationships:** Ensembles can handle complex relationships in the data by leveraging the complementary strengths of different models. This is especially useful when the underlying data distribution is not well-behaved.\n",

    "Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble technique in machine learning. Bagging involves creating multiple subsets of the training dataset by random sampling with replacement. Each subset is used to train a separate base model, typically of the same type, such as decision trees. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all base models, often by majority voting for classification or averaging for regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of bagging are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bootstrapping:** Each subset of the training data is created by randomly selecting data points with replacement. This means that some data points may be repeated in a subset, while others may not be included at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parallel Training:** Base models are trained independently on their respective subsets in parallel, which can significantly speed up the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduction of Variance:** Bagging aims to reduce the variance of the predictions by combining multiple models. It is particularly effective when the base models are prone to overfitting.\n",

    "Boosting is an ensemble technique in machine learning that combines multiple weak or base learners to create a strong predictive model. Unlike bagging, which trains base models independently in parallel, boosting trains them sequentially in a way that focuses on the examples that were misclassified by the previous models. The main idea behind boosting is to give more weight to the samples that are difficult to classify, thereby improving the model's performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boosting process typically works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train a base model on the original dataset.\n",
    "2. Increase the weights of the misclassified examples.\n",
    "3. Train the next base model, giving more importance to the misclassified examples from the previous model.\n",

These percentiles represent the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval.\n",
