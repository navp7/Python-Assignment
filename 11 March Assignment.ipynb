    "Both t-tests and z-tests are statistical tests used for hypothesis testing and making inferences about population parameters based on sample data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**T-Test:**\n",
    "A t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and needs to be estimated from the sample data. It is also suitable for small sample sizes. There are different types of t-tests, including one-sample t-test, independent two-sample t-test, and paired two-sample t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z-Test:**\n",
    "A z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known or when the sample size is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply. It assumes that the population follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example scenario for each type of test:\n",
    "\n",
    "**T-Test Example:**\n",
    "Suppose you want to test the effectiveness of a new drug in reducing blood pressure. You collect blood pressure measurements from a sample of 20 patients before and after administering the drug. You want to determine if there is a significant difference in blood pressure before and after treatment. Since you have a small sample size and the population standard deviation is unknown, you would use a paired two-sample t-test to compare the means of the paired measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z-Test Example:**\n",
    "Imagine you work for an electronics company that produces a specific component. You want to assess whether the mean lifespan of your component is consistent with a specified value of 500 hours. You have a large dataset of component lifespans and know the population standard deviation is 50 hours. In this case, you could use a one-sample z-test to compare the sample mean lifespan to the specified value, as the large sample size and known population standard deviation make the z-test appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between a t-test and a z-test depends on factors such as sample size and knowledge of the population standard deviation. If the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large, a z-test is appropriate. If the population standard deviation is unknown or the sample size is small, a t-test is more suitable."

In other words, it's a false alarm where you conclude that there is a significant effect or difference when there is none in the population.

    "Balancing these two types of errors is essential in hypothesis testing. Researchers often set a significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) to control the risk of committing a Type 1 error, and they consider factors such as sample size and effect size to minimize the risk of committing a Type 2 error.
