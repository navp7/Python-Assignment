    "#### Ans: \n",
    "#### An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Difference:\n",
    "### An error is an issue in a program that prevents the program from completing its task. In comparison, an exception is a condition that interrupts the normal flow of the program. Both errors and exceptions are a type of runtime error, which means they occur during the execution of a program. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### In simple words, the error is a critical issue that a normal application should not catch, while an exception is a condition that a program should catch. "
