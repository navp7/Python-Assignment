    "a) Artificial Intelligence (AI): Artificial Intelligence refers to the creation of intelligent agents that can mimic human cognitive functions such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. These agents can process and analyze large amounts of data to make informed decisions. For example, AI is used in virtual personal assistants like Apple's Siri, which can understand natural language and perform tasks like setting reminders, sending messages, and providing weather updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Machine Learning (ML): Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data without explicit programming. ML algorithms can identify patterns in data and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions. A notable example is email spam filtering. A machine learning model can be trained on a dataset of labeled emails (spam or not spam) and learn to classify new, incoming emails as either spam or not spam based on the patterns it has learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep Learning (DL): Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers, known as deep neural networks. These networks can automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, allowing them to handle complex tasks like image and speech recognition. An example is image classification, where deep learning models can accurately identify objects in images by learning intricate features at different levels of abstraction."

    "Unsupervised learning is a machine learning approach where the algorithm is tasked with finding patterns or structure in unlabeled data.
