    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data's noise and fluctuations rather than the underlying patterns. As a result, the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. The consequences of overfitting include poor performance on new data, decreased model interpretability, and an increased likelihood of capturing noise in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting, on the other hand, happens when a model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It leads to poor performance on both the training data and new data. Underfit models usually have high bias and fail to capture the complexity of the relationship between inputs and outputs.\n",

    "1. **Regularization**: Introduce penalties for complex model parameters to avoid extreme parameter values.\n",
