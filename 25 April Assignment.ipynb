    "\n",
    "For a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach, it must satisfy the following conditions:\n",

    "1. **Non-Defective Matrix**: The matrix must be non-defective. A matrix is considered non-defective if it has a sufficient number of linearly independent eigenvectors to form a complete basis for the vector space. In other words, there must be enough linearly independent eigenvectors to span the entire space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Complete Set of Linearly Independent Eigenvectors**: The matrix must have a complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors. This means that for each distinct eigenvalue, there must be a linearly independent eigenvector. A complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors ensures that the matrix can be diagonalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's provide a brief proof of these conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condition 1: Non-Defective Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "To show that a matrix is non-defective, we need to demonstrate that it has a sufficient number of linearly independent eigenvectors. We'll use a proof by contradiction to illustrate the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there exists a square matrix A that is defective, meaning it doesn't have enough linearly independent eigenvectors to form a complete basis for the vector space. In other words, for at least one eigenvalue, there are not enough linearly independent eigenvectors associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If A is defective, it implies that there is a Jordan block associated with at least one eigenvalue. A Jordan block is a specific type of matrix structure that arises when a matrix is defective. It is a block matrix where the eigenvalue appears repeatedly along the main diagonal, and there are non-zero entries just above the main diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if A has a Jordan block, it cannot be diagonalized, as Jordan blocks cannot be transformed into a diagonal matrix. Diagonalization requires a complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors for each eigenvalue, which is not the case for a matrix with Jordan blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if a matrix is non-defective, it doesn't have Jordan blocks and has a sufficient number of linearly independent eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. Such a matrix can be diagonalized using the Eigen-Decomposition approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condition 2: Complete Set of Linearly Independent Eigenvectors**\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of a complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors is essential for diagonalization. If a matrix doesn't have a complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors, it implies that there is some eigenvalue for which there aren't enough linearly independent eigenvectors. In such cases, the matrix cannot be diagonalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this condition, consider that the matrix A can be diagonalized as A = PDP^(-1), where P is the matrix of eigenvectors and D is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. If there are not enough linearly independent eigenvectors for a specific eigenvalue, it would result in the matrix P not being invertible, which would prevent diagonalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, a square matrix can be diagonalized using the Eigen-Decomposition approach if and only if it is non-defective (without Jordan blocks) and has a complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors. These conditions ensure that the matrix can be transformed into a diagonal matrix, simplifying various mathematical operations and providing insights into its behavior."

    "\n",
    "Certainly! The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a square matrix have a meaningful geometric interpretation in the context of linear transformations. Let's explore this interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eigenvectors (Direction):** An eigenvector of a matrix represents a direction in the vector space that remains unchanged in direction after the matrix transformation. In other words, when you apply the matrix to the eigenvector, the resulting vector is a scaled version of the original eigenvector. The eigenvalue represents the scale factor (stretching or compression) in that direction.\n",

    "   - If the eigenvalue is zero, the eigenvector is unchanged (invariant) by the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Geometrically, eigenvectors are the principal directions of stretching or compression associated with the matrix transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Eigenvalues (Scale Factor):** Eigenvalues are scalar values that indicate the amount by which the corresponding eigenvector is stretched or compressed. They represent the scale factor of the linear transformation along the direction defined by the eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If an eigenvalue is 1, it means no scaling occurs in that direction.\n",
