    "\n",
    "- **Homogeneity:** Homogeneity measures the extent to which each cluster contains only data points that are members of a single class. In other words, it assesses whether the data points within each cluster share the same true class labels. High homogeneity indicates that clusters are composed of highly similar data points in terms of their true class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Completeness:** Completeness measures the extent to which all data points that are members of the same class are assigned to the same cluster. It assesses whether all data points from the same true class label end up in the same cluster. High completeness suggests that the algorithm has successfully grouped all data points from the same class into a single cluster.\n",
