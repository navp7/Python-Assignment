    "   - **Traditional Hosting**:\n",
    "     - Servers are physically located in specific data centers, which may limit geographic redundancy and content delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Cloud Hosting**:\n",
    "     - Cloud data centers are distributed worldwide, allowing for better content delivery and the ability to choose server locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Security**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Traditional Hosting**:\n",
