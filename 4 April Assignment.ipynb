    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the values of the features. The main steps of the algorithm are as follows:\n",

    "- **Training:** The algorithm starts with the entire dataset at the root node (the top of the tree). It selects the feature that provides the best split, i.e., the feature that best separates the data into distinct classes or reduces impurity the most. The goal is to create subsets (child nodes) that are as pure as possible in terms of class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Nodes:** The nodes in the tree represent decisions made based on the features. These decisions are binary in the case of a decision tree classifier, meaning they split the data into two branches. Each decision node has a condition associated with it.\n",

    "The mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification involves finding the best feature and the best split point for that feature that minimizes impurity or maximizes information gain. Key concepts include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Entropy:** Entropy is a measure of impurity or disorder in a set of data. In decision trees, it's used to measure the disorder of classes in a dataset. For a binary classification problem (two classes, say 0 and 1), the entropy is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  \\[E(S) = -p_0 * log_2(p_0) - p_1 * log_2(p_1)\\]\n",

    "  \\[Information Gain = E(Parent) - \\sum(\\text{Weighted Entropy of Child Nodes})\\]\n",

    "  \\[Gini(S) = 1 - (p_0^2 + p_1^2)\\]\n",

    "A decision tree classifier can solve binary classification problems by recursively splitting the data into subsets to make predictions. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training:** The decision tree starts with the entire dataset, which includes instances with two class labels (usually 0 and 1 for binary classification). It chooses the feature that provides the best split, based on minimizing impurity (e.g., Gini impurity) or maximizing information gain. The decision tree makes a decision node based on this feature and split point.\n",

    "3. **Leaf Nodes:** The recursion continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum depth, a minimum number of samples in a node, or no further information gain. When the recursion stops, leaf nodes are reached.\n",

    "4. **Predictions:** To make a prediction for a new data point, you start at the root node and follow the path through decision nodes based on the feature values of the input data. Eventually, you reach a leaf node, and the class label associated with that leaf node is the prediction (either 0 or 1 in a binary classification problem).\n",

    "The geometric intuition behind decision tree classification can be understood as creating a set of decision boundaries in feature space to separate different classes. Each decision node in a decision tree corresponds to a splitting boundary, and each leaf node corresponds to a region in feature space where a specific class is predicted.\n",

You continue this process until you reach a leaf node, and the class label associated with that leaf node is your prediction.\n",
