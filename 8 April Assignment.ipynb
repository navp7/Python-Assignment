    "While developing an SVM regression model to predict house prices based on multiple characteristics, it's essential to choose a regression metric that aligns with the specific goals of your application. Here are a few regression metrics to consider in this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual house prices. It provides a straightforward interpretation of the average prediction error in the same units as the target variable (e.g., dollars). MAE is robust to outliers and provides a clear measure of prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Use MAE when you want to know the average prediction error without considering the direction of the error. It is suitable when all errors, whether overestimations or underestimations, have equal importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: MSE measures the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual house prices. It penalizes larger errors more heavily. MSE is commonly used and has desirable mathematical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Use MSE when you want to give more weight to larger errors and when the metric should be sensitive to the magnitude of errors. However, be cautious of its susceptibility to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: RMSE is the square root of MSE and is expressed in the same units as the target variable. It provides a way to interpret the prediction error in a more understandable scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "   RMSE is a balance between MAE and MSE. Use RMSE when you want an interpretable measure of prediction accuracy with a sensitivity to the magnitude of errors but without the squared units of MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **R-squared (R2)**: R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable explained by the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Use R-squared when you want to understand how well the independent variables explain the variation in house prices. However, it does not directly measure prediction accuracy, and a high R-squared does not guarantee good predictions."

    "When dealing with a dataset that has a significant number of outliers, the most appropriate regression metric for evaluating the performance of your Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is Huber Loss or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for choosing Huber Loss or MAE in this scenario is that they are robust to outliers. Unlike the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which heavily penalizes large errors, Huber Loss and MAE are more resistant to the influence of outliers. They provide a more balanced assessment of model performance, especially when the dataset contains significant outliers that could disproportionately affect the MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Huber Loss combines the characteristics of both MSE and MAE by using a threshold parameter to switch between the two loss functions based on the error magnitude. This makes it suitable for datasets with a mix of regular and outlier data points. MAE, on the other hand, is entirely based on the absolute differences between predicted and actual values, making it less sensitive to outliers"
